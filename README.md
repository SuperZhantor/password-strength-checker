# Password Strength Checker (GUI)

---

## 1. Project Title
**Password Strength Checker (GUI)** — A Python-based desktop application that analyzes the strength of user-entered passwords through a simple and intuitive graphical interface.

---

## 2. Project Description
This project is designed to help users understand how secure their passwords are by analyzing several key characteristics such as length, character variety, repeated characters, and more.  

It uses **Python’s Tkinter library** to create a clean graphical interface where users can input a password and receive instant feedback through color-coded message boxes (Green, Yellow, or Red).  

### What the application does:
- Evaluates passwords for strength using multiple security criteria  
- Prevents insecure inputs (spaces, short length, repeated characters, and common passwords)  
- Provides feedback via a user-friendly GUI  

### Why these technologies:
- **Python** for simplicity and readability  
- **Tkinter** (built-in GUI library) for creating a lightweight desktop interface without external dependencies  

### Challenges and future goals:
- Challenge: Handling multiple edge cases (like long repeated characters or space errors)  
- Future features:
  - A live progress bar for password strength
  - Password suggestions for improvement
  - Dark mode GUI
  - Integration with password databases to detect breached passwords
